        As an Undergraduate Research Intern, I focused on the development of innovative soft actuators and sensors. My key contributions included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed soft actuators and sensors and their control systems.</li>
        <li>Contributed to the development of a cutting-edge sEMG sensor.</li>
        <li>Improved sensor stretchability using innovative materials.</li>
        <li>Refined algorithms for sEMG sensor accuracy using neural networks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This experience enriched my knowledge in soft robotics and sensor technology.</p>
